    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Choose activities wisely
            <p>Try and bike or walking tour instead of a tour bus, where you can still get a unique experience of the city without the expense of polluting or harming the environment</p></li>
        <li>Volunteer!
            <p>Amsterdam rewards those clearing rubbish from the waterway with a free canal tour and breakfast, while in Reykjavik you can enjoy the hike and forest reseeding program to combat the damage of overtourism. Alternatively, animal lovers can visit animal reuse centres, present in almost every city</p></li>
        <li>Be wary of captive animals
            <p>With the exceptions of some sanctuaries or conservancies, animals kept in  captivity and used as tourist attractions or for entertainment purposes is, in our opinion, highly unethical. Avoid captive dolphins and whales, performing animals such as bears, big cats or dancing monkeys, and riding elephants.</p> </li>
        <div>“All elephants must be broken in order for them to work, be around humans and give rides. One traditional way of doing this is “phajaan”, or “crushing the spirit”. This is a horrific ritual, where a young elephant is kept tied down in a cage and may be deprived of food, beaten, burned and stabbed to literally beat it into submission”</div>

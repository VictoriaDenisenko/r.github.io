    <h2>where to go.</h2>
    <p>As a general rule the further you travel from home, the larger your carbon footprint becomes. However, if you do want to go further some destinations are a lot more sustainable than others:</p>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Visit sustainable cities 
            <p>Some of the most sustainable cities in the world are Copenhagen, Stockholm, Berlin and  Portland (to name a few). They achieved this due to their investment into green alternatives, public transport, pedestrian and cycling infrastructure and commitment to protecting green areas and saving waste water.</p>
        </li>
        <li>When you must visit a crowded and popular city
            <p>Concerns are increasing about “overtourism” occurring in cities such as Bangkok, Florence and Barcelona. These highly visited cities are under pressure from rising costs, overcrowding, environmental damage and strain on local resources due to overtourism. 
                If you choose to visit such cities, experts suggest visiting outside of peak summer months, choosing accredited accommodation (using sites like bookdifferent.com, which ensures claims to sustainability are checked by third parties), and find local activities that benefit local residents instead of the more popular tourist traps.

                </p>
        </li>
        <li>Visit places that need your support
            <p>One valuable way of spending your money is to visit destinations rebuilding after a disaster. For example Puerto Rico has developed a robust tourism sector after facing a disastrous hurricane in 2017. You can further help by volunteering in local environmental and social projects helping to rebuild devastated communities. </p>
        </li>
        <li>Choose coats with a Marine Protected Area
            <p>If you plan to go to a coastal destination, choose on with a Marine Protected area to ensure local communities are involved in protecting landscapes and aquatic life.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Avoid all inclusive package deals or resorts
            <p>Few countries benefit directly from these as the foreign owned tourism company owns the hotel, airline, ground transport and often excursion providers. UK charity Tourism Concern’s research found that only 10% of tourism spend from all inclusive holidays in Turkey found its way into the regional economy, with even less reaching the immediate local area.</p>
